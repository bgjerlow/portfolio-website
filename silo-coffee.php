				<h3 class="itemSection">The project</h3>
				<p class="itemText">In connection with a study trip to Berlin, we were asked to find a client to design and develop a website for. Our client for this project was a small café in Friedrichshain called Silo Coffee.</p>
				<p class="itemText">During our time in Berlin, we had an interview with the client, conducted interviews with customers and non-customers, checked out competitors, and observed the café and its customers on a typical weekday. After a week in Berlin, we returned home to Denmark to design and develop the website.</p>
				<p class="itemText">In this project, my area of focus was the development of the website.</p>
				<p class="itemText">For a more detailed description of this project and our process, I recommend checking out <a href="archive/silo-coffee-report.pdf" class="itemLink">the report we wrote in connection with it.</a></p>
				
				<h3 class="itemSection">The design</h3>
				<p class="itemText">Using the knowledge gained from our research, we designed and developed a website for Silo Coffee. The website’s content and layout were built for personas that are representative of the client’s target groups.</p>
				<p class="itemText">The goal of the website is to provide users with all the practical information they should need and to transmit the atmosphere of the café through high-quality pictures. Furthermore, we have also connected the website with the client's excellent use of social media. <a href="http://project.bgjerlowdesigns.com/Project_1.2/" class="itemLink">You can view the full site here</a></p>
