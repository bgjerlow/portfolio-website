				<h3 class="itemSection">The project</h3>
				<p class="itemText">For the first-year exam project of the Multimedia Design and Communication programme at Business Academy Aarhus, I and my team (three fellow students) created a visual identity and website for the app While You Wait. While You Wait is an app that helps restaurants, hairdressers and similar businesses with customer management.</p>
				<p class="itemText">During this project, my area of focus was on the website design and development. Furthermore, I also took on the role as SCRUM master, making sure that we utilised the SCRUM method throughout the project.</p>
				<p class="itemText">For a more detailed description of this project and our process, I recommend checking out <a href="archive/while-you-wait-report.pdf" class="itemLink">the report we wrote in connection with it.</a></p>
				
				<h3 class="itemSection">Website design</h3>
				<p class="itemText">Having done field and desk research which gave us a better understanding of the client's product and their customers, we created personas based on the user interviews we conducted. The personas were kept in mind when designing and creating content for the website. During the process of planning/designing/developing the website, we conducted usability tests to ensure that the site was easy to navigate and that it fit with our personas needs.</p>
				
				<p class="itemText">The goal of the website is to provide users with an overview of features and benefits of the application, while at the same time contributing to raising the level of trustworthiness of the company through recommendations, thorough contact information, and information about the company (their story, mission, vision and similar). <a href="http://project.bgjerlowdesigns.com/Project_2.2_Exam/index.php" class="itemLink">You can view the final site here</a></p>
