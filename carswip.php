            <h3 class="itemSection">The project</h3>
            <p class="itemText">In November 2017, Carswip hired me to take over the development of their new website, create content for it, and launch it.</p>

            <p class="itemText">Carswip is a Danish startup who specialises in photo optimisation for used car dealerships. They currently work with some of the biggest and most exclusive used car dealerships in Denmark, and are growing rapidly.</p>
            
            <p class="itemText">When I took over, parts of the project were already in place. The general design of the website had been defined, and the development in Ruby On Rails had been begun. While four of the websiteâ€™s pages (Home, Pricing, About Us, and Contact) had been started on, significant changes were made to the design and layout of these pages. In addition, pages for Cases and the Catalogue page were created from scratch.</p>

            <p class="itemText">The new Carswip website was launched on December 21st 2017, and can be seen at <a href="http://www.carswip.com/" class="itemLink">www.carswip.com</a></p>
            
            <h3 class="itemSection">The Final Website</h3>
            <p class="itemText">The full final website can be seen at <a href="http://www.carswip.com/" class="itemLink">www.carswip.com</a></p>
            
            <p class="itemText">To give an idea of the level of adjustments/changes that were made to the existing pages between me taking over and the website being launched, a comparison of the Home page can be seen below (click to view full-size).</p>
