            <h3 class="itemSection">The project</h3>
            <p class="itemText">For the 3rd-semester exam project of the Multimedia Design and Communication programme at Business Academy Aarhus, I and my team (Jevgenijs Zaicevs, Viliam Birmon, and Milan Kharel) created a campaign website for a Danish music and film festival named SPOT Festival. The timeframe for the project was 6 weeks.</p>

            <p class="itemText">My area of focus for this project was the design and development of the website. The website was developed using HTML5, Sass, JavaScript/jQuery, MySQL, and PHP.</p>

            <p class="itemText">In addition to the website, we also created a promotional video (which can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR9l82QdGRI" class="itemLink">here</a>) and promotional material in the form of a poster and flyer. The poster and flyer, as well as a detailed description of the project and process, can be found in <a href="archive/spot-festival-report.pdf" class="itemLink">the report we wrote in connection with this project.</a></p>

            <p class="itemText">Please note that this project is unsolicited, and was not done in cooperation with SPOT Festival representatives.</p>

            <h3 class="itemSection">The Final Website</h3>
            <p class="itemText">Based on field and desk research, we designed and developed a campaign website for the 2017 edition of SPOT Festival. The campaign site includes basic information about the festival, the festival programme, accommodation information for tourists, as well as a page about volunteer opportunities for the festival. The Home page we created can be seen below, and <a href="http://project.bgjerlowdesigns.com/Project_3.2/" class="itemLink">the full website can be seen here.</a></p>
