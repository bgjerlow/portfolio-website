        <p id="aboutIntro" class="aboutText">Hi, I'm Bo Gjerl&oslash;w, a multimedia designer based in Denmark.</p>

        <p class="aboutText">I currently work at <a href="http://www.carswip.com/" class="itemLink">Carswip</a> as a Digital Brand Manager. In this role, I work with UI/UX design, web development (mainly front-end), digital marketing and lead generation.</p>
