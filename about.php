        <p id="aboutIntro" class="aboutText">Hi, I'm Bo Gjerl&oslash;w, a multimedia designer based in Denmark.</p>
      
        <p class="aboutText"> I specialize in UI/UX design and front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby on Rails), but also have skills within Digital Marketing and Communication.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutText">In the summer of 2017, I graduated from Business Academy Aarhus with an AP degree in Multimedia Design and Communication. During my time there, I specialised in UI/UX design and front-end development.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutText">Outside of design and web development, my interests also include cars, motorsport, technology, and football.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutText">When not working, I like to watch motorsport (particularly the FIA World Endurance Championship), play racing games, and keeping up with the latest news.</p>
