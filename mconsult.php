				<img src="img/portfolio/mconsult/mconsult-logo.jpg" class="itemImage itemImageMargin" alt="MConsult logo">
				<p class="itemText">A proposal of a visual identity for a Danish accounting company that specialises in helping small businesses.</p>
				<p class="itemText">This project was done as a part of my educational programme at Business Academy Aarhus.</p>
				
				<h3 class="itemSection">Logo - Concept</h3>
				<p class="itemText">The green squares make up a circle and represent that MConsult handles multiple processes at once by automating various accounting tasks. The 'M' inside the circle is the initial of the founder of MConsult whose name is Mie.</p>
				<p class="itemText">The graph used in the place of the 'L' represents that this is a company that is in the accountant industry.</p>
				<p class="itemText">There are two variations of the logo: The small/medium version (intended to be used for stationary items &amp; the web), and the large version (intended to be used for vehicles, banners, and similar). The difference between the two is that the large version has a tagline saying 'Moderne revision' (In English = Modern accounting).</p>

				<h3 class="itemSection">Color scheme &amp; typography</h3>
				<p class="itemText">The logo is made up of three colours: green (to symbolise youth and renewal), blue (to symbolise stability and trust), and grey (to symbolise reliability).</p>
				<img src="img/portfolio/mconsult/mconsult-logo-color-palette.jpg" class="itemImage itemImageMargin" alt="MConsult - Logo color palette">
